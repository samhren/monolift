- [ ] Build reusable UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure WCAG AA contrast compliance
- [ ] Set up typography and spacing scales

#### 3.3 Core Screens

- [ ] **Workouts Tab**: Template cards with FlatList
- [ ] **Calendar Tab**: Month view with react-native-calendars

- [ ] **Settings/Profile**: Basic user settings
- [ ] Navigation between screens and deep linking

#### 3.4 Local Database & Models

- [ ] SQLite schema matching Postgres structure
- [ ] Local CRUD operations for exercises, templates, sessions, sets
- [ ] Sync queue implementation for offline changes
- [ ] Data persistence and retrieval logic

### Phase 4: Offline-First Sync System üî∂ MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 4.1 Client Sync Logic

- [ ] Detect network connectivity changes
- [ ] Queue local changes when offline
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates with rollback
- [ ] Background sync on app foreground
- [ ] Conflict resolution UI for user decisions

#### 4.2 Sync Queue Management

- [ ] Batch operations for efficient syncing
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Handle partial sync failures

#### 4.3 Data Integrity

- [ ] Validate data consistency between local/remote
- [ ] Handle edge cases (app killed during sync, etc.)
- [ ] Implement sync debugging tools
- [ ] Add sync analytics and monitoring

### Phase 5: Advanced Features & UX ‚ö° HIGH PRIORITY

#### 5.1 Workout Flow

- [ ] Start workout from template
- [ ] Set entry with weight/reps input
- [ ] Rest timer with notifications
- [ ] Exercise substitution/notes
- [ ] Workout completion and summary

#### 5.2 Progress Tracking

- [ ] 1RM calculation and history (Epley formula)
- [ ] Weekly volume charts
- [ ] Progress photos (optional future)
- [ ] Personal records tracking
- [ ] Workout streak tracking

#### 5.3 Template Management

- [ ] Create/edit workout templates
- [ ] Exercise library with search/filter
- [ ] Template sharing (future)
